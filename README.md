# hey-all
first repository

hello, there, passers by! You've come to a place of flickering signals.
we can't say when these shall return to a normal, the work is in progress.
By normal, what's meant is continuous flow- smooth and harmonic brain waves.
If this seems too much of uncommon talk, here's some common talk.

So, I made this repo going by the guide, an awesome guide, provided for noobs to the site.
I think I'm able to follow it very well. Don't be daunted, you have help.
I'm going to be working with the game-engine, unity.
There's some really cool things we can make with it together.
That should be it for now, passers by! Have a nice day x
